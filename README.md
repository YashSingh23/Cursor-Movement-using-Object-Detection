# Cursor-Movement-using-Object-Detection
This project presents an innovative method for cursor movement using object detection, implemented through the integration of OpenCV and PyAutoGUI. The proposed approach leverages computer vision techniques from the OpenCV library to detect and track specific objects or gestures in real time.
