# Cursor-Movement-using-Object-Detection
This paper presents an innovative method for cursor movement using object detection, implemented through the integration of OpenCV and PyAutoGUI. Traditional cursor control methods rely on input devices such as mice or touchpads, limiting their applicability in certain contexts. The proposed approach leverages computer vision techniques from the OpenCV library to detect and track specific objects or gestures in real time, subsequently translating these detections into cursor movements using the PyAutoGUI library.
